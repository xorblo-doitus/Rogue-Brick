# EasySetting's Listeners compatible with other addons

These folders conatain ESL that work with Nodes created by other addons.
The name of each folder is the name of the addon it handles.

**Uncheck the folders handling addons that you don't use** when installing from
asset library, or **delete them** if they are already downloaded. If you don't,
there will propably be parsing errors caused by static typing. (And because it's
useless to have scripts that wont be used...)
